<h1>Horizontal Evapotranspiration Boundary NL[i] and Vertical Evapotranspiration Boundary NL[i]</h1>
<b>Back to <a href="contents.htm">Contents</a></b>
<p>

The Horizontal Evapotranspiration Boundary NL[i] represents a horizontal boundary so that evapotranspiration occurs in a vertical direction. 
The Vertical Evapotranspiration Boundary NL[i] represents a vertical boundary so that evapotranspiration occurs in a horizontal direction. 

You can not set any of the evapotranspiration boundary simply by setting the default value of the layer. You must use contours to
define the evapotranspiration boundary. 

Any cells that are enclosed within closed contours on the Horizontal Evapotranspiration Boundary NL[i] will be assigned evapotranspiration boundaries. 
Any cells that are intersected by any contour on the Vertical Evapotranspiration Boundary NL[i] will be assigned evapotranspiration boundaries. However, cells that are enclosed but not intersected by a contour on the Vertical Evapotranspiration Boundary NL[i] will not be assigned evapotranspiration boundaries.

Time[i] is the time of the start of the next stress period for the current object. Time1 should always be set to 0. Each Time[i] value should be larger than it's predecessor. However, different objects do not need to have the same values for Time[i].
If Time[i] is $N/A, other temporal data for this time period for this object will be ignored.  See &quot;<a href="timetab.htm#maximum">Maximum number of time periods to be used for any object</a>&quot; for more information
