<h3><a name="trouble10">I manually deleted or renamed some locked layers or parameters and now Argus ONE crashes when I try to export the model.</a></h3>
Do not manually delete or rename locked layers or parameters. They are locked for a reason. You are sure to run into trouble if you mess with them. You will need to manually recreate the layers or parameters you destroyed with exactly the same names as before to correct this problem. 
<h3><a name="endorse">Has the HST3D GUI been endorsed by Ken Kipp, the author of HST3D?</a></h3>
No. Although Ken Kipp was very helpful in answering questions about HST3D during the development of the HST3D GUI,  he has never endorsed the HST3D GUI. In fact, as a USGS employee, he is prohibited from endorsing it. 

<h3><a name="mobility">What does the term <i>mobility</i> mean?</a></h3>
Mobility refers to the ease with which water that will flow between an
aquifer and a well for a given head gradient. Thus, as permeability increases, 
mobility also increases. For unconfined aquifers, mobility also depends on 
the saturated thickness. As the saturated thickness increases, the 
mobility increases. Changes in viscosity due to changes in temperature or 
salinity also affect mobility. Mobility is also affected by the well bore diameter. 
When the diameter is larger, it is easier for water to flow to or from the well.

<h3><a name="difference">What</a> is the difference between <i>specified temperature</i> and <i>temperature at specified pressure</i>?</h3>

At specified temperature boundaries, the fluid will be set to the 
specified temperature at the boundary regardless of the amount or 
direction of fluid flux. For example, If there were a buried sealed 
container of radioactive material, the heat of the radioactive material
might cause the fluid to be heated near the container. However, there
wouldn't necessarily be any fluid flow associated with that source of
heat. 
<p>

At a specified pressure boundary, fluid may either leave or enter the
model domain. If the fluid enters the model domain, the temperature of the
fluid is determined by the &quot;<i>temperature at specified pressure</i>&quot;. If the
fluid leaves the model domain at the specified pressure boundary, the
&quot;<i>temperature at specified pressure</i>&quot; is ignored 
and the resident temperature at that point of the boundary determines the
temperature of the exiting fluid.
