<h1>Wells Layer</h1>
<b>Back to <a href="contents.htm">Contents</a></b>
<p>
The &quot;Wells&quot; layer appears under the &quot;Unindexed Layers&quot; group layer if the &quot;Wells&quot; checkbox is checked on the Processes/Boundaries tab of the Edit Project Info Dialog box. The parameters that appear on the Wells layer depend on the other options selected for the model.
<p>
Only one well is allowed in any one cell. Multiple wells in a cell must be represented by an equivalent single well, or the spatial grid must be refined to separate them. This restriction includes wells that are located in the same areal cell that are completed in different vertical intervals.

The &quot;Label&quot; parameter is provided as a convenience to the user. You may use it to identify individual wells. In the future, the Label may be exported to the HST3D input file as a comment. It serves to identify a well in the same way that the HST3D variable IWEL does. However, IWEL does not depend on &quot;Label&quot;. The HST3D IWEL parameter is assigned by the HST3D PIE based on the order in which the wells were added to the model.

<p>
&quot;<a href="#Mobility">Mobility</a>&quot; is determined by the permeability of a cell the dimensions of the cell, the well radius, and the viscosity of the fluid. See Kipp (1987) equations 2.4.1.2 and 2.4.1.5.
<p>
&quot;Pressure difference&quot; is difference in pressure between the average pressure of the cell and the pressure inside the well.
<p>
If a &quot;Limiting pressure&quot; is used in an injection well, and the pressure calculated with the <a href="#flow">specified flow rate</a> is greater than the limiting pressure, the flow rate will be reduced so that the limiting pressure is not exceeded. If a &quot;Limiting pressure&quot; is used in an production well, and the pressure calculated with the <a href="#flow">specified flow rate</a> is less than the limiting pressure, the flow rate will be reduced so that the well pressure does not fall below the limiting pressure.

A well completion factor of one means the geometric mean of the horizontal permeability for that element will be used in the well index. An well completion factor of zero means the well is cased off from the aquifer in that element. A reduced permeability around the well bore can be approximately represented by specifying a completion factor less than one. Note that this is not the same as a well-skin factor. You should not use a cell complection factor of 0 for the element just below the Top Completion Elevation or just above the Bottom Completion Elevation. Instead, adjust the Top or Bottom Completion Elevations. The well-completion factor also can be used to compute an approximate effective permeability for a well that is completed in a cell that contains multiple zones of different permeability.

<p>
A positive skin factor corresponds to a reduced permeability around the well bore. An enhanced permeability around the well bore can be approximately represented by specifying a skin factor less than zero. Note that this is not the same as a well-completion factor.

Time[i] is the time of the start of the next stress period for the current object. Time1 should always be set to 0. Each Time[i] value should be larger than it's predecessor. However, different objects do not need to have the same values for Time[i].
If Time[i] is $N/A, other temporal data for this time period for this object will be ignored.  See &quot;<a href="timetab.htm#maximum">Maximum number of time periods to be used for any object</a>&quot; for more information

<p>
Mass fraction at the well datum for this well for the time period starting at Time[i]. Surface and well-datum concentrations are equal , so this variable also is used to specify surface conditions for an injection well.

</UL>
<p>
Scaled mass fraction at the well datum for this well for the time period starting at Time[i]. Surface and well-datum concentrations are equal , so this variable also is used to specify surface conditions for an injection well.

<b><a name="Mobility">Mobility</a>: </b><br>

Mobility refers to the ease with which water that will flow between an
aquifer and a well for a given head gradient. Thus, as permeability increases, 
mobility also increases. For unconfined aquifers, mobility also depends on 
the saturated thickness. As the saturated thickness increases, the 
mobility increases. Changes in viscosity due to changes in temperature or 
salinity also affect mobility. Mobility is also affected by the well bore diameter. 
When the diameter is larger, it is easier for water to flow to or from the well.
