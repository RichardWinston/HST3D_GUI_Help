<p>
If you wish to see a time series of the output from an HST3D model, Select &quot;<a href="project.htm#observ">Use Observation Elevations</a>&quot; in the Edit Project Info dialog box. Then on the <a href="observpoints.htm">Observation Points</a> layer use point contours or open contours to define the locations of you observations points. Then select &quot;HST3D Time Series...&quot; from the PIE menu. Next select one of the HST3D output files. After a brief pause, the data will be plotted. You can select what type of data to plot and which data series to plot on the Series tab. If you don't like the appearance of the plot, you can change it's appearance on the &quot;Format Plot&quot; tab.

You can print the plot by clicking the Print button. You can also save the data to a tab-delimited text file which you can then easily import into a spreadsheet.
<p>

If you right click on the chart, a pop-up menu will appear which will allow you to save the plot in several formats or to copy it to the clipboard.
