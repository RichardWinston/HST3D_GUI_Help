<h1>Horizontal Heat Conduction Boundary NL[i] and Vertical Heat Conduction Boundary NL[i]</h1>
<b>Back to <a href="contents.htm">Contents</a></b>
<p>

The Horizontal Heat Conduction Boundary NL[i] represents a horizontal boundary so that heat conduction occurs in a vertical direction. 
The Vertical Heat Conduction Boundary NL[i] represents a vertical boundary so that heat conduction occurs in a horizontal direction. 

You can not set  heat conduction boundaries simply by setting the default value of the layer. You must use contours to
define the heat conduction boundaries. 

Any cells that are enclosed within closed contours on the Horizontal Heat Conduction Boundary NL[i] will be assigned heat conduction boundaries. 
Any cells that are intersected by any contour on the Vertical Heat Conduction Boundary NL[i] will be assigned heat conduction boundaries. However, cells that are enclosed but not intersected by a contour on the Vertical Heat Conduction Boundary NL[i] will not be assigned heat conduction boundaries.
