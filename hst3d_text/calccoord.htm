<h1>How to convert HST3D Coordinates to Argus ONE coordinates</h1>
<b>Back to <a href="contents.htm">Contents</a></b>
<p>
When you run HST3D with a rotated grid, the coordinates used by HST3D are in a coordinate system that is rotated with respect to the 
Argus ONE coordinate system. However, it is easy to convert them to the Argus ONE coordinates. For example in the DOS window shown below, The maximum change in pressure occurs at (4.144E+04, 2.924E+06).

To convert those to the Argus ONE coordinates select &quot;PIEs|Calculate Coordinates&quot;. A dialog box box will appear. Enter the HST3D coordinates and press the &quot;Calculate Argus Coordinates&quot; button. The equivalent Argus coordinates will be calculated along with the row and column numbers of the cell with those coordinates.

You can then use the &quot;Navagation|Go to Position&quot; menu item within Argus ONE to show you exactly where that position is.
