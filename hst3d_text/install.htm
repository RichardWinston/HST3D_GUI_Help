The HST3D PIE comes with an installation program that installs the PIE and associated help files. Just run the installation and the PIE will be installed. If you wish to uninstall the PIE, shut down Argus ONE and run the uninstaller. The HST3D, BCFLOW, and DIMEN programs are installed in a compressed form and must be manually uncompressed before they can be used. To uncompress them, run the file Hst3dEXEs.exe which is in the ArgusPIE\Hst3d_gui directory or use a zip-extractor to extract individual files. Together, the three programs require approximately 72 Mb of disk space.
