<h1>Map Layers and Maps</h1>
<b>Back to <a href="contents.htm">Contents</a></b>
<p>

The &quot;Maps&quot; layer is provided as a convenience. You can import scanned images, shape files, dxf files, and various other sorts of data to &quot;maps&quot; layers to use them as base maps for your model. You can also add text and draw shapes on the map layer. See the Argus ONE documentation for more details.<p>
You can create additional map layers if you wish. You may find it convenient to keep all the map layers together under the &quot;<a href="mapsgroup.htm">Map Layers</a>&quot; group layer but you may create map layers wherever you like.
