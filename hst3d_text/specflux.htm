<h1>Vertical Specified Flux Boundary NL[i] and Horizontal Specified Flux Boundary NL[i]</h1>
<b>Back to <a href="contents.htm">Contents</a></b>
<p>

The Horizontal Specified Flux Boundary NL[i] represents a horizontal boundary so that the flux occurs in a vertical direction. 
The Vertical Specified Flux Boundary NL[i] represents a vertical boundary so that the flux occurs in a horizontal direction. 

You can not set any of the specified flux parameters simply by setting the default value of the layer. You must use contours to
set the specified flux parameters. 

Any cells that are enclosed within closed contours or intersected by any type of contour on the Horizontal Specified Flux Boundary NL[i] will be assigned specified flux boundaries. 
Any cells that are intersected by open or closed contours on the Vertical Specified Flux Boundary NL[i] will be assigned specified flux boundaries. You should not use point contours on Vertical Specified Flux Boundary NL[i] layers.
<p>
Because HST3D does not allow a specified flux boundary in any cell with a specified pressure boundary, the HST3D PIE will ignore any specified flux boundary cells that are also specified state boundary cells.

Time[i] is the time of the start of the next stress period for the current object. Time1 should always be set to 0. Each Time[i] value should be larger than it's predecessor. However, different objects do not need to have the same values for Time[i].
If Time[i] is $N/A, other temporal data for this time period for this object will be ignored.  See &quot;<a href="timetab.htm#maximum">Maximum number of time periods to be used for any object</a>&quot; for more information

XFlux Positive[i] determines the direction of the x-component of fluid, heat, or solute flux in the Vertical Specified Flux Boundary NL[i] for Time[i]. If XFlux Positive[i] is true, the flux in the x direction will be positive. Otherwise, the flux will be negative. This parameter only sets the direction of the flux, not the magnitude.

Fluid Flux[i] represents the magnitude of the horizontal fluid flux across the vertical flux boundary. Fluid Flux[i] should always be positive. The direction of flux is set with XFlux Positive[i] and YFlux Positive[i].
