Finite-difference models can have either block-centered nodes or grid-centered nodes.

HST3D uses grid-centered nodes which is better for entering boundary conditions. However, it is normally
more difficult to enter data about aquifer properties in models with grid-centered nodes. With block-centered
nodes, you can assign the aquifer properties to the cells because the boundaries between cells are also normally
the boundaries between materials with different properties. With grid-centered nodes, the aquifer properties typically
change at the center of the cell rather than at the cell boundaries. To overcome, this limitation, HST3D defines 
&quot;Elements&quot; which comprise parts of one to 8 cells. The elements have their corners at the nodes whereas 
the cells have their centers at the nodes. Aquifer properties are entered for by element and boundary conditions are
entered by cells.

In Argus ONE, you should create a block-centered grid to define the elements. The nodes will be at the corners of each block. The
HST3D PIE (plug-in extension) will take care of mapping the block-centered grid used for defining elements to the grid-centered 
grid used for defining cells.
