Choice of aquifer-influence functions (IAIF) Default: Pot aquifer for outer-aquifer region HST3D Variable: IAIF Data Set Record Number: 2.18.3 There are two different aquifer influence functions that can be used with HST3D as explained by Kipp (1987, p. 60-68, 134-139). You must select which function you wish to use. The Carter-Tracy approximation is used to avoid successive recomputation of the convolution integral that gives the flow rate at the transient aquifer-influence-function boundary. The Carter-Tracy approximation is exact for constant-flow rates. Thus, slowly varying flow rates are handled more accurately by the Carter-Tracy approximation than rapidly varying ones. The major disadvantage of the Carter-Tracy approximation is the inaccuracy of the computation of the discrtized flow rate in the case where boundary flow rates vary with time. Effects on the computed-flow rate appear as a significant time lag and smoothing of transients. Errors can be serious for boundary-flow rates whose variations are large relative to the average value.

To do this, you will need the source code for HST3D which is available from Ken Kipp at the USGS. You will also need to provide your own include files that specify the dimensions needed for your project. Creating the include files is easy using the DIMEN program. To run it, first locate the input file for an HST3D model created by Argus ONE. This file will have the name you specified on the Output tab of the Edit Project Info dialog box. Copy or move the file into the same directory as the DIMEN program. Copy the following include files into the same directory: param1.inc, param2.inc, param3.inc, param4.inc, param5.inc, param6.inc. These files are included with the source code for HST3D. Double click on DIMEN.exe. The program will prompt you for the input file name, an output file name (whatever name you want) and will then ask you whether you want the minimum dimensions sufficient to run the input file you gave it or to just increase the dimensions of the arrays that are too small. It will then write new include files. Copy the new include files back to the directory with the HST3D source code and recompile following the instructions of your compiler. If you use the Lahey Fortran 90 compiler, you can use the Automake.fig file provided with the HST3D PIE to compile a suitable version of HST3D by changing to the directory with the HST3D source code and clicking the Automake button. You should also be able to recompile HST3D with any other Fortran 90 compilers and most Fortran 77 compilers. There are a couple things that can go wrong while running DIMEN. If the include files are in a Unix format rather than a DOS format, the line terminations may not be recognized by versions of DIMEN running on Windows 95 or Window NT. To correct this open the file with a text editor and save the files to disk. Some text editors can read Unix text files and will save them in the proper format for Windows 95 and Windows NT. You may have to make some minor change to the file in order to save it such as adding a blank space at the end of a line. I haven't tested this with all text editors but EditPad from http://www.ping.be/jg/ works well for this purpose. If DIMEN terminates adnormally for some reason a temporary file that it creates named input.strp will not be deleted. You will need to delete this file before running DIMEN again. If you do not have a compiler and do not wish to purchase one, you can request a recompiled version of HST3D from hst3dgui@mindspring.com. You will have to provide the include files created by DIMEN. You can have up to three free newly recompiled versions. Additional recompilations cost $20.00 each. Back to Contents copyright, 1998^0^0";

If using backward-in-space or backward-in-time differencing, make some estimates of the truncation error using parameter values at the limits expected for the simulation. Thus, verify that the grid-spacing and time-step selection do not introduce excessive numerical dispersion. See Kipp, 1987, table 3.1, p. 114. If using centered-in-space and centered-in-time differencing, print results every time step for a short simulation period, 5-10 time steps. Examine the results for spatial and temporal oscillations that are caused by the time or space discretization being too coarse. Check on spatial-discretiztion error by refining the mesh. However, this often is impractical for large regions. A check on temporal-discretization error is relatively easy to make by refining the time-step length for a short simulation. At each change of boundary condition or source flow rates, reduce the time step until the abrupt changes have had time to propagate into the region. The automatic time step alogorith does this. To adequately represent a sharp solute-concentration or temperature front, span it with at least 4-5 nodes. A large number of nodes may be required if a sharp front moves through much of the region over the simulation time. Compromises often will have to be made. An advantage of the centered-in-space differencing is that oscillations will reveal when the grid is too coarse relative to the gradients of solute concentration or temperature. Well flows that highly stress the aquifer require a small time step after a change in flow rate to control errors from explicit flow-rate allocation or explicit well-dataum pressure calculation. Sometimes the global-balance summary table will indicate that the time step is too large by exhibiitng large residuals, particularly if the density and viscosity variations are large. To check for unusual results that could indicate discretization error, print out all of the results some of the time and some of the results all of the time.

You choose which you wish to use by selecting the appropriate radio button. on the bottom right corner of the fluid properties tab. Then enter the value you wish to use in one of the two edit boxes labeled Viscosity multiplication factor (VISFAC} and Viscosity (VISFAC) Only one of these two boxes will be enabled depending on which radio button you selected. Note: the HST3D documentation states that you use a negative value for VISFAC to make it a constant viscosity value rather than a viscosity multiplication factor. However, you don't enter a negative value for VISFAC in the PIE. The PIE takes care of converting constant viscosity values to a negative numbers when creating the input file for HST3D. According to McCutcheon, Martin and Barnwell (1993), viscosity can be calculated with the following formula log10 (/100) = [1301/(998.333 + 8.1855(T-20) + 0.00585(T-20)2)] - 1.30233 (for T = 0 to 20 oC). log10 (/) = (1.3272(20-T) - 0.001053(T-20)2)/(T+105) (for T = 20 to 100 oC). Kipp (1997) section 2.2, gives another set of formulas incorporating the effects of salinity and temperature. Kipp's formula is built into HST3D. If you use the viscosity multiplication factor, the viscosity used in the model is that calculated by the built-in function times the viscosity multiplication factor.

HST3D uses grid-centered nodes which is better for entering boundary conditions. However, it is normally more difficult to enter data about aquifer properties in models with grid-centered nodes. With block-centered nodes, you can assign the aquifer properties to the cells because the boundaries between cells are also normally the boundaries between materials with different properties. With grid-centered nodes, the aquifer properties typically change at the center of the cell rather than at the cell boundaries. To overcome, this limitation, HST3D defines Elements which comprise parts of one to 8 cells. The elements have their corners at the nodes whereas the cells have their centers at the nodes. Aquifer properties are entered for by element and boundary conditions are entered by cells. In Argus ONE, you should create a block-centered grid to define the elements. The nodes will be at the corners of each block. The HST3D PIE (plug-in extension) will take care of mapping the block-centered grid used for defining elements to the grid-centered grid used for defining cells.

Has the HST3D GUI been endorsed by Ken Kipp, the author of HST3D? What does the term mobility mean? What is the difference between specified temperature and temperature at specified pressure? I manually deleted or renamed some locked layers or parameters and now Argus ONE crashes when I try to export the model. Do not manually delete or rename locked layers or parameters. They are locked for a reason. You are sure to run into trouble if you mess with them. You will need to manually recreate the layers or parameters you destroyed with exactly the same names as before to correct this problem. Has the HST3D GUI been endorsed by Ken Kipp, the author of HST3D? No. Although Ken Kipp was very helpful in answering questions about HST3D during the development of the HST3D GUI, he has never endorsed the HST3D GUI. In fact, as a USGS employee, he is prohibited from endorsing it. What does the term mobility mean? Mobility refers to the ease with which water that will flow between an aquifer and a well for a given head gradient. Thus, as permeability increases, mobility also increases. For unconfined aquifers, mobility also depends on the saturated thickness. As the saturated thickness increases, the mobility increases. Changes in viscosity due to changes in temperature or salinity also affect mobility. Mobility is also affected by the well bore diameter. When the diameter is larger, it is easier for water to flow to or from the well. What is the difference between specified temperature and temperature at specified pressure? At specified temperature boundaries, the fluid will be set to the specified temperature at the boundary regardless of the amount or direction of fluid flux. For example, If there were a buried sealed container of radioactive material, the heat of the radioactive material might cause the fluid to be heated near the container. However, there wouldn't necessarily be any fluid flow associated with that source of heat. At a specified pressure boundary, fluid may either leave or enter the model domain. If the fluid enters the model domain, the temperature of the fluid is determined by the temperature at specified pressure. If the fluid leaves the model domain at the specified pressure boundary, the temperature at specified pressure is ignored and the resident temperature at that point of the boundary determines the temperature of the exiting fluid. copyright, 1998^0^0";

Is there a good way of dealing with them too? The answer is yes although it requires a little work. First you need to create layers that define the aquifer geometry. For example, this layer shows contours for the bottom of one aquifer. Similar layers could be created to define the surfaces of the other aquifers. Next we need to create layers that define the properties of the aquifer or aquifers. Here we have layers for porosity, permeability, and vertical compressibility. We assign the aquifer properties to these layers. Finally we create expressions that link the unit layers to the aquifer layers. This, for example, is an expression for Permeability Unit1.kx If((Elev Bot Aquifer1 <HST3D Grid.Elevation NL1 + HST3D Grid.Elevation NL2 / 2), Permeability Aquifer1, If((Elev Bot Aquifer2 <Grid.Elevation + HST3D Grid.Elevation NL2 / 2), Permeability Aquifer2, 0)) This expression makes use of two parameters on the HST3D Grid Layer: PIE: HST3D Grid.Elevation NL1 and HST3D Grid.Elevation NL2. In words, the expression says that if the middle of the element is above the bottom of the Aquifer1 use the permeability in the Permeability Aquifer1 layer. Otherwise, check if the middle of the element is above the bottom of Aquifer2 use the permeability in the Permeability Aquifer2 layer. If it isn't above the bottom of Aquifer2, set the permeability to 0. You can easily develop similar expressions for other units and parameters. Here is an example of one parameter value assigned using this method. The blue cells are in the upper aquifer; the red ones are in the lower aquifer. The contours represent the elevation of the surface between the upper and lower aquifers. Back to Contents copyright, 1998^0^0";

Instead any cell enclosed or intercepted by a contour is assigned the value of that contour. However, there is a way around this. Here's what you do. Create a new information layer and put on it the information that you wish to use to define the property on the node layer. With the expression editor, make the default value of the Node layer the new information layer that has the data you entered. On the HST3D Grid Layer select File|Export|By Template. Import the file you just exported into the node layer as a text file. By default the file will be named HST3D_Grid.exp. If you change the grid on the HST3D Grid layer, you will have to delete the points on the node layer and redo the previous two steps. The export template on the HST3D Grid layer creates a point contour at each of the HST3D nodes.

To begin postprocessing, select HST3D Postprocessing from the PIEs menu in an HST3D model. The Postprocessing dialog box will appear. Click the Read Data button to read an HST3D data set. An Open file dialog box will appear which you can use to select from among three output files created by HST3D. These are the PMAP files (Pressure, Temperature, and Mass Fraction), the PMAP2 files (Potentiometric Head, Density), and the VMAP files (X-, Y-, and Z-velocities). When you have read a data set two more tabs will appear in the Postprocessing dialog box. After reading data from one output file, you can read data from additional output files by clicking the Read Data button again. The first of these shows a spreadsheet with the boundary condition codes as explained in Kipp (1997) Section 6.5. The second new tab shows a spreadsheet with the grid configuration. The three columns shows the nodal locations in the X-, Y- and Z- directions respectively. On the original tab the labels of the data read from the output file will be listed in two boxes. If you select one of the data sets in the upper box, another new tab will appear with a spreadsheet containing that data. (This may take a few seconds). The first sheet contains the data from the lowermost node layer and the additional sheets have data for progressively higher layers. Row 1 of the spread sheet has the data from the first row of the model. However, note that the rows are labeled from top to bottom in the spreadsheet but from bottom to top in the model. You can save any of the spreadsheets to disk by clicking the save button. You can save the data in a variety of formats including as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Although only one set of data can be displayed on the Data tab at a time, you can import multiple data sets to Argus ONE to create postprocessing objects. Select the data set or sets you wish to import from the list of data items with check boxes. Next select the way you wish to import it from the controls at the bottom of the Postprocessing dialog box. You can plot data along a layer to get a map view of the data or along a vertical slice along a row or column. If you have selected Use Observation Elevations, you can also make a plot along a user-defined surface. The PIE will automatically create four of the six types of postprocessing charts supported by Argus ONE (3D Surface, Color Diagram, Contour Map, and Cross Section). See the Argus ONE documentation for details of these chart types. You can also chose which row column or layer you wish to import data from. (At present, to import data from multiple rows, columns, or layers, you must first import data from one row, column, or layer into Argus ONE, rename the HST3D Data and HST3D PostProcessing Charts layers and then go back to import additional data.) Press the OK button to create the Postprocessing chart or charts. This will read the data into the HST3D Data layer and create a postprocessing chart on the HST3D Postprocessing Charts layer. If the HST3D Postprocessing Charts layer already exists, you will be prompted if you want to clear the layer to write the new charts. The PIE does not automatically create vector and pathline charts but you can add these yourself easily. Just select the appropriate data sets from the VMAP file and import the data to any type of postprocessing chart. You will then have the data in Argus ONE and you can create the vector or pathline chart on a map layer by selecting the vector or pathline tool and outline the area where you wish to display the chart. The postprocessing PIE does not apply any vertical exaggeration to data along vertical slices. When viewing post processing charts along vertical slices, you may wish to use a non-uniform scale to apply vertical exaggeration. This can be done in the Special|Scale and Units dialog box.

HST3D allows the title lines to be up to 80 characters long. However, if the first character of the line is a C, the line will be treated as a comment. To avoid this, the HST3D PIE automatically inserts a blank character before the begining of each line entered in the Title Line boxes. This limits the number of characters that can be exported to HST3D for either title line to 79. If more than 79 characters are in either title line edit box, only the first 79 characters will be accepted. Units (EEUNIT) Default: metric units HST3D Variable: EEUNIT Data Set Record Number: 1.4 Internally, HST3D uses metric (SI) units. However, it can convert US customary units to metric units. You must use one of the sets of units given on the Units page throughout the model unless you change the conversion factors internal to the simulator. Conversion factors are given on p. vii of Kipp, 1987. If some of your data are in US customary units and some are in SI units, you can use the Conversion PIE from Argus Interware or the MoreConversions PIE that comes with the HST3D PIE to convert the data to the proper units. If you change your choice of units, all values in the Edit project dialog box will be converted to the current units and any new parameters on Argus ONE information layers will have default values appropriate for your choice of units. However, the default values and data on existing information layers will not be changed. Time Units (TMUNIT) Default: seconds HST3D Variable: TMUNIT Data Set Record Number: 1.5 TMUNIT selects the time unit of the simulation. All of the temporal data must use the time unit indicated by TMUNIT. Use Observation Elevations Default: not checked HST3D Variable: none If you check this box, three new layers will be created Observation Elevation Nodes, Observation Surface, and Observation Points. These are used in postprocessing. If you set elevations on Observation Surface and have a grid-centered grid on Observation Elevation Nodes that corresponds to the block-centered grid on the HST3D Grid layer, the post-processing PIE can create a map of the data following the defined surface on Observation Surface. This surface can be irregular and need not follow the grid boundaries. The PIE will take care of determining which cells it needs to extract data from. If you manually created the grid on the HST3D Grid layer, you can use the PIEs|Create Observation Grid to create a grid-centered grid that corresponds to the block-centered grid on the HST3D Grid layer. Otherwise, you can just use the magic wand tool as usual. The Observation Points layer is used to define observation locations for time series plots. Restart previous simulation (RESTRT) Default: not checked HST3D Variable: RESTRT Data Set Record Number: 1.3 HST3D gives you the capability of restarting a simulation from the restart-record file. This can be useful if the initial stages of a model give valid results but later stages do not. You can change the input for the latter stages without rerunning the earlier stages of the simulation. See TIMRST, CHKPTD, and PRICPD. Restart Time (TIMRST) Default: 0 HST3D Variable: TIMRST Data Set Record Number: 1.3 TIMRST is the time at which the simulation is to be restarted. The time specified in TIMRST must be within 0.1% of a time in the restart record. See RESTRT, CHKPTD, and PRICPD. Coordinate System (CYLIND) Default: Cartesian HST3D Variable: CYLIND Data Set Record Number: 1.4 CYLIND indicates whether a cartesian or cylindrical coordinate system is used. At present only cartesian coordinates are supported in the HST3D Graphic User Interface (GUI). Mass Fraction (SCALMF) Default: scaled mass fraction HST3D Variable: SCALMF Data Set Record Number: 1.4 HST3D can use either unscaled or scaled mass fractions. If the unscaled mass fraction is w, the scaled mass fraction (w') is w' = (w - wmin)/(wmax - wmin) The scaled mass fraction, ranging from 0 to 1, is often more convenient for presentation of results. (See section 2.2, equation 2.2.1.2, Kipp (1987) for more information.) IMPORTANT: Even if you use scaled mass fractions, W0 and W1 must still be unscaled mass fractions. Tilted Coordinate System (TILT) Default: not checked HST3D Variable: TILT Data Set Record Number: 2.3.1 Unless the model has a free surface (a water table), HST3D allows the cooridinate system to be tilted. If you wish to use a tilted coordinate system, click the TILT check box. You will then be able to enter values for THETXZ, THETYZ, and THETZZ.

Use Open contours to set the position of rivers. HST3D requires that diagonal river segments must be oriented in NW, NE, SW or SE direction such that the increment in node number is equal in x and y directions. This will be 45 degrees for a regular mesh. (Kipp, personal communication, 1998.) However, there is no such restriction when using the PIE because the PIE cuts each contour into segments that are acceptable to HST3D. If you define a river in a layer below the top, the simulator will define the river to be in the top layer of nodes but connect it to the cells containing the water table even if they change as time progresses. (Kipp, personal communication, 1998.) You can not define a river that cuts a canyon through several layers of cells. (Kipp, personal communication, 1998.) A river leakage boundary is not allowed in any cell with a specified pressure boundary. Up to eight rivers can occur in a single cell.

Then select Run HST3D from the PIEs menu. The Run HST3D dialog box will appear You have a choice of running HST3D, just creating the input file for HST3D, running BCFLOW or just creating the input file for BCFLOW. In either case, you should make sure that the path for the program you run is correct. You can type the correct path in the appropriate dialog box or click the Browse button to locate the HST3D executable. You can also choose an batch file of your own that will call HST3D or BCFLOW. As part of the export process a batch file named RunHST3D.BAT or RunBCFLOW.BAT will be created. If you choose to create the HST3D input file but do not choose to run HST3D immediately, you can double click on that file later in the Windows Explorer to start HST3D or BCFLOW with the current input file. The path you enter for HST3D or BCFLOW Path will be saved with the file when you save your project. If you wish to edit non-spatial parameters before starting to run HST3D, you can click on the Edit Parameters button to bring up the Edit Project Info dialog box. You start the export process by clicking the Export button. Click the Cancel button if you decide not to export the HST3D input file. When you click the export button a progress bar will appear briefly as the PIE processes the export template prior to passing it to Argus ONE. Once that is done, an Save File dialog box will appear. Use this to chose the directory in which to create the HST3D input file. This can be whatever directory you choose. However it is generally a good idea to put the HST3D input file in a special directory for the project so that it is easy to distinguish them from other files. It is generally a bad idea, for example, to put the input files in the ArgusPIE directory or a subdirectory of it because you might then accidentally erase one of the files that the PIE needs to run. The file name that appears in the Save File dialog box is not important. The name of the file that is created is determined by the Input File name on the Edit Project dialog box not the name shown in the Save File dialog box. Once you have selected the directory for the HST3D input file, the default Argus ONE barbershop pole progress bar will appear followed by another progress bar created by the PIE. The progress bar created by the PIE will the elapsed time and an estimate of the time left before beginning the next phase of the export process. There are three phases to the export process. Phase 1, where the PIE prepares the export template for Argus ONE (This is typically fast). Phase 2, where Argus ONE exports the problem specifications and dimensions and the static data (Data sets 1.1 through 2.23.5). Phase 3, where Argus ONE exports the transient data (Data sets 3.1 through 3.99). If you chose to run HST3D, it will start running when the export process is complete if you specified the path correctly. If you did not specify the path correctly, you can edit RunHST3D.BAT with any text editor to specify the correct path and then double-click it to start HST3D. You do not need to type any responses to the questions that appear in the DOS box when HST3D begins to run. The RunHST3D.BAT batch file automatically passes the correct responses. You can cancel the export of the HST3D input files in several ways. On the Run HST3D dialog box click the Cancel button On the Save File dialog box click the Cancel button Make the default Argus ONE barbershop progress bar the active window and click Ctrl-C If you choose to write your own batch file that the HST3D PIE can call to start HST3D you may wish to clear the Pause when done checkbox. If this check box is checked, the DOS window in which HST3D runs will pause when HST3D finishes so that you can read any messages from HST3D. However, this will also prevent the remainder of your batch file from executing until you press a key on the keyboard. One reason you might write your own batch file to start HST3D is so that the batch file could start a program that would sound an alarm when HST3D was done so that you would know it was finished.

Factor for spatial-discretization (FDSMTH) Default: 0.0 HST3D Variable: FDSMTH Data Set Record Number: 2.22.1 FDSMTH should be 0.5 for centered-in-space differencing used for advective terms FDSMTH should be 0.0 for upstream-in-space differencing used for advective terms Intermediate values may be used. If using centered in space differencing, the mesh Peclet number (Pe) should be less than about 2. Pe = delta x/ alpha or delta y/ alpha where delta x is the grid size in the x direction, delta y is the grid size in the y direction, and alpha is dispersivity in the direction of flow (ALPHL). If you don't follow this advice, HST3D may calculate large negative values of scaled concentrations especially in regions with large concentration gradients. Centered in space and centered in time methods are free of numerical dispersion but may result in oscillation of the solution. Upstream in space will remove oscillation but at the cost of numerical dispersion. See the discretization guidelines for more information. Factor for temporal-discretization (FDTMTH) Default:1.0 HST3D Variable: FDTMTH Data Set Record Number: 2.22.1 FDTMTH should be 0.5 for centered-in-time or Crank-Nicolson differencing FDTMTH should be 1.0 for backward-in-time or fully-implicit differencing Intermediate values may be used. Central-in-time differencing has the potential for causing oscillations in the solution whereas bacwards-in-time differencing does not. However, backwards-in-time differencing does introduce numerical dispersion that must be kept under control by limiting the time-step size. Centered in space and centered in time methods are free of numerical dispersion but may result in oscillation of the solution. A common practice is to start with a fully implict models to make sure they can run properly and then shift to centered in time to check for numerical oscillation. See the discretization guidelines for more information. Tolerance in fractional change in density for convergence (TOLDEN) Default: 0.001 HST3D Variable: TOLDEN Data Set Record Number: 2.22.2 Tolerance in fractional change in density for convergence over a solution cycle of flow, heat, and solute equations at a given time plane. Default = 0.001 Maximum number of iterations per cycle (MAXITN) Default: 5 HST3D Variable: MAXITN Data Set Record Number: 2.22.2 Maximum number of iterations allowed for a cycle of pressure, temperature, and mass-fraction solutions allowed at a given time plane. Default set at 5. Solution method (SLMETH) Default: triangular-factorization direct solver HST3D Variable: SLMETH Data Set Record Number: 1.8 Select the solution method for the solver. Storage requirements probably will determine when it is necessary to use an iterative solver. The DIMEN pre-processing program writes out the storage requrements for each matrix sover for each renumbering method. The HST3D program writes out the storage requirements for the solver selected. For large problems, use of the direct solver is impractical. Number of time steps between recalculations of the optimum-overrelaxation parameter (NTSOPT) Default: 5 HST3D Variable: NTSOPT Data Set Record Number: 2.22.3 Number of time steps between recalculations of the optimum-overrelaxation parameter. Default set at 5. Tolerance (EPSSLV) Default: 1e-7 HST3D Variable: EPSSLV Data Set Record Number: 2.22.3 and 2.22.4 If the two-line successive overrelaxation solver is used, EPSSLV is the tolerance for the two-line successive-overrelaxation iterative solution of the fractional change in any of the values of the dependent variable must be less than or equal to this tolerance times (2-wopt). where wopt = the optimum-overrelaxation parameter. If the conjugate-gradient solver is used with either renumbering scheme, EPSSLV is the tolerance on the relative residual for the restarted conjugate-gradient iterative solution of the matrix equations at each time plane. The Euclidean norm of the changes in the vector of the dependent-variable values must be less than or equal to this tolerance. Experience with test problems has shown that a tolerance of 10-6 to 10-12 is necessary to obtain 3 or 4 digit agreeement with the direct solver. Default is 10-7. Tolerance on the fractional change in the overrelaxation parameter (EPSOMG) Default: 0.2 HST3D Variable: EPSOMG Data Set Record Number: 2.22.3 Tolerance on the fractional change in the overrelaxation parameter during the iterative calculation to determine the optimum value. Default set to 0.2 Maximum number iterations allowed for the calculation of the optimum overrelaxation parameter (MAXIT1) Default: 50 HST3D Variable: MAXIT1 Data Set Record Number: 2.22.3 Maximum number of iterations allowed for the calculation of the optimum overrelaxation parameter. Default set at 50. Maximum number of iterations allowed for the solution of the matrix equations (MAXIT2) Default: 100 HST3D Variable: MAXIT2 Data Set Record Number: 2.22.3 Maximum number of iterations allowed for the solution of the matrix equations. Default set at 100. Under some conditions, the user may need to double or triple the default limit of 100. However, more than a few hundred iterations indicates that adjustments probably need to be made in the spatial or temporal discretization. Renumbering order (IDIR) Default: xyz HST3D Variable: IDIR Data Set Record Number: 2.22.4 Choose the order for node renumbering. The first direction increments fastest. The last increments most slowly. The optimum choice can often be determined by running short simulations with 1 or 2 time steps. Usually, they group into three paris of nearly equal iteration counts. Number of steps between restarts of solver (NSDR) Default: 5 HST3D Variable: NSDR Data Set Record Number: 2.22.4 Number of steps between restarts of the generalized conjugate-gradient solver. Defalut set at 5. The solver does not seem to be very sensitive to this parameter. Usually 5 works well. If solver convergence requires more than about 100 interations, the number should be increased to 10 or 15. Preconditioning method (IORDER) Default: modified incomplete LU factorization HST3D Variable: IORDER Data Set Record Number: 2.22.4 Choose between standard incomplete LU factorization and the modified incomplete LU factorization with no fill-in. Often the modified incomplete LU factorization gives a faster convergence. Back to Contents copyright, 1998^0^0";

You must use contours to set the specified state parameters. Any HST3D Cell that is enclosed or intercepted by a closed contour will be assigned the value of that contour. Any HST3D Cell intercepted by a point or open contour will be assigned the value of that contour. If a cell is assigned a value through two or more contours, the value ultimately used by HST3D will depend on the order in which the contours were created. The value assigned with the most recently created contour will be the one used by HST3D. See how to use Argus ONE's interpolation methods on node layers for a method of overcoming the limitations of how data on node layers is defined. You can enable interpolation for the parameters on the Specified State Layer. See Interpolation in the HST3D PIE for more information.

You must first choose whether to use a Cartesian or Cylindrical coordinate system. (At present, the PIE only supports a Cartesian coordinate system.) This will bring up the Edit Project Info Dialog box. You use this to enter non-spatial information in your model such as the title lines. (You can edit this information again at any time by selecting Edit Project Info from the PIEs menu.) You also use the Elements tab of this dialog box to set the vertical discretization. One of the first things you will probably wish to decide is what processes to simulate and what types of boundary conditions to use. Select these on the Processes/Boundary Tab. When you have finished entering the nonspatial data, click the OK button and the PIE will create an Argus ONE layer structure for the model that reflects your choices. You will need to outline the area to be simulated on the Domain Outline layer and assign the default grid density. If you have a base map, you may wish to import it into the maps layer so that you can refer to it when outlining the study area. Refer to the Argus ONE documentation for how to import scanned images, DXF files, and other sorts of files into the Map layers. If you wish to create a uniform grid, you can change to the HST3D Grid layer and click the Magic Wand tool anywhere inside the domain outline to create a grid. For a non-uniform grid, use the Grid Density layer to control the grid size. The main place that you enter data for the model is not in the HST3D Grid layer but rather in the information layers such as the Permeability Element Layer1 layer. The HST3D PIE creates exptressions for grid layer parameters that link the properties of the individual grid cells to the information on the information layers. If you do not manually override the values for any cell, you can delete the grid and make a new one with a different grid spacing and/or angle without loss of information. Thus, it is advantageous to enter the data on the information layers rather than directly on the grid cells. There are a variety of methods for entering data on information layers. If you wish to use the same value for the entire layer, you can just set the default value to a number. You can also put points, lines or polygons on the layer to define properties. In Argus ONE, as in other Geographic Information Systems, these are referred to as point contours, open contours, and closed contours respectively. Collectively, they are referred to as objects. If you use the Exact Contour Method the interior of the the polygon will be assigned the value(s) you assign to the polygon. You could also draw a series of point contours and use the Interpolation Method to assign values. If several layers need to have the same information, use the Expression Editor to link them. You can make the default value of one layer be a second layer. Whatever data you then apply to the second layer will automatically apply to the first layer as well. You could also define more complex relationships among layers using expressions. The use of expressions to define relationships among different layers is one of the most powerful features of Argus ONE. You should definitely learn how to use it. Consult the Argus ONE documentation for details. Back to Contents copyright, 1998^0^0";

This can be inconvenient when large numbers of wells or other items have temporal variables that change at different times because the user would need to compare all the times to determine when to enter new data. The HST3D PIE simplifies data entry by doing all these comparisons for you. You just need to specify the time schedule for each object without worrying about how that relates to the times for other objects. For example, suppose you had four specified pressure boundaries that all changed at different times. Specified Pressure Boundary 1: From time = 0 to 3: pressure = 5 Pa From time = 3 to the end of the model: pressure = 4 Pa Specified Pressure Boundary 2: From time = 0 to the end of the model: pressure = 4 Pa Specified Pressure Boundary 3: From time = 0 to 7: pressure = 6 From time = 7 to the end of the model: pressure = 5 Pa Here's how you would enter the data for these three boundaries. Specified Pressure Boundary 1 Specified Pressure Boundary 2 Specified Pressure Boundary 3 For the first and third boundaries, we specify different values of the Time2 parameter to show when those different objects change their properties. For the second boundary we leave Time2 set at the default value of $N/A (not available). That causes all data for that time step to be ignored. The number of different Time parameters that are available for all objects is set by Maximum number of time periods to be used for any object. in the Edit Project Info dialog box. Note that in all cases, Time1 is 0. The time the simulation begins is at 0 and all times are measured relative to the beginning of the model. The time units are set with Time Units (TMUNIT) in the Edit Project Info dialog box. Also note that you must specify the properties of the boundary condition for the first time period and that a boundary condition can never become inactive. Back to Contents copyright, 1998^0^0";

Tips I want to copy a contour from one layer to another but I don't want to copy the parameter values for the contour. How can I do this? I want to copy all of the data in the Edit Project Info dialog box from one model to another. How can I do that? I am dealing with an aquifer with a non-uniform top or bottom elevation. Is there an good way of dealing with this in the HST3D PIE? I want to export the output from an HST3D model to another program. Is there a good way to do this? Troubleshooting Where is HST3D HST3D, DIMEN, and BCFLOW are in a compressed file named Hst3dEXEs.exe in the ArgusPIE\Hst3d_gui directory. Run Hst3dEXEs.exe or use a zip-extractor to extract individual files. Together, the three programs require approximately 72 Mb of disk space. I changed the Maximum number of time periods for any object to a smaller number and Argus ONE stops responding. What wrong? Deleting parameters is slow when there are a large number of layers or parameters in the current version of Argus ONE (4.1.0t). If you wait, it should finish... eventually. Tell Argus to make this process more efficient. I changed an option so that the PIE should delete some layers but Argus ONE has stopped responding. What wrong? Deleting layers is slow when there are a large number of layers or parameters in the current version of Argus ONE (4.1.0t). If you wait, it should finish... eventually. Tell Argus to make this process more efficient. When I try to run HST3D from Argus ONE, HST3D doesn't start and I get an error message in the DOS window. This is most frequently due to insufficient available memory. Try shutting down as many programs as possible and try again. Argus ONE can take up a lot of memory so it might be a good one to shut down. You do not need to re-export the HST3D input file to start HST3D. Just click on the RunHST3D.bat file in the file explorer. I've run HST3D but when I try to open the output file in the HST3D Postprocessor, I get the error message Invalid Numerical Data If you ran out of disk space while running HST3D, the output file may be incomplete. Free up disk space and rerun HST3D The file may have ********** in place of valid numerical data. This occurs if the HST3D is trying to print a number that is too large to fit in the available space. This probably means that the input you have entered is invalid in some way. I opened a file and got the message Unable to read some data from this file. If you save this file, the extra data will be lost. Contact PIE developer for assistance. The file you are attempting to read has data that your version of the HST3D PIE is unable to process. This may be because it was created with a new version of the HST3D PIE. If so, you need to get a copy of that version to ensure that the data is read properly. Your curent PIE will not be able to save the data it could not read so you should not save this file with the same name as you opened it with or you will overwrite the existing file. I opened a model and I got the message Attempting to read data from a later version of the HST3D PIE. Is this a problem. This is a warning message but it doesn't mean that there is anything wrong. Each time you save a model, the version of the PIE that you have installed is saved with the model. When opening the model, the pie compares the version in the file and tells you if the file was created by a later version. If there is no other message, all the data in the file was read correctly and will be saved correctly when you save the file. When using the Import Temporal Data and Import Monthly Data methods, existing parameter values of $N/A are converted to 0. Argus ONE does this when copying a contour to the clipboard. See Importing Time-Dependent Data for what to do about it. On the time tab, I want to enter data for multiple time periods but when I select the time period I want, I can't type anything in it. Change the duration of the previous time period to a non-zero value. See Time in the HST3D PIE. I clicked the delete button on the Time tab of the Edit Project Info dialog box but there are still the same number of time periods as before. What is wrong? Clicking the delete button deletes the data for the selected time period but it is not supposed to change the number of time periods. To do that, change the number of time periods in the edit box labelled Maximum number of time periods for any object. I manually deleted or renamed some locked layers or parameters and now Argus ONE crashes when I try to export the model. Do not manually delete or rename locked layers or parameters. They are locked for a reason. You are sure to run into trouble if you mess with them. You will need to manually recreate the layers or parameters you destroyed with exactly the same names as before to correct this problem. Tips I want to copy a contour from one layer to another but I don't want to copy the parameter values for the contour. How can I do this? You should be able to do this: Select Special|Preferences. In the dialog box, select the clipboard icon. Uncheck the Copy parameter values check box. Then copy and paste the contour. However, in version 4.1.0t, there appears to be a bug that prevents this from working properly. Here is a work-around. Create a new information layer. Copy the contour from the source layer and paste it on the new information layer. Copy the contour from the new information layer to the layer and paste it on the layer where you want it to be. Double click on the contour and delete the value of the first parameter. I want to copy all of the data in the Edit Project Info dialog box from one model to another. How can I do that? See Setting Default Values. I am dealing with an aquifer with a non-uniform top or bottom elevation. Is there an good way of dealing with this in the HST3D PIE? Yes. See Dealing with Irregular Aquifer Geometry. I want to export the output from an HST3D model to another program. Is there a good way to do this? Import data into Argus ONE with the postprocessing PIE. Switch to the HST3D Data layer. Select View|Show Values. Select the columns you wish to copy by holding down the shift key while clicking on the column heading. Copy to the clipboard with Ctrl-C. Paste in a spreadsheet with Ctrl-V.

One of these, MoreConversions.dll, provides a convenient method of performing the conversions listed on p. vii of Kipp (1987). The conversions are available in the Expression editor. No attempt was made to check the accuracy of the conversions factors in Kipp (1987) or to increase their precision. The other PIE, JoinContoursPie.dll, provides a method for combining multiple contours into a single contour and to reduce the number of vertices in contours. Both PIE's can be used with any Argus ONE project, not just HST3D projects. You may sometimes wish to join contours together to make it easier to manipulate them. To join contours together, select Join Contours from the File|Import menu on any information layer. A dialog box will appear listing the information layers. Select the layer in which you want to combine contours. The PIE will read the contours from the layer. If any two contours have exactly the same starting or ending point and all their parameter values are the same, those contours will be combined into a single contour. Here is an illustration of the effect of the Join Contours method. The first illustration shows the situation before joining contours. There are numerous short contours with parameter values of -70 and -80 . In the second illustration, those numerous contours have been combined into a much smaller number of contours. Before Join Contours applied After Join Contours applied If two contours have starting or ending points that are even slightly different, the contours will not be combined. To ensure that such contours are combined, make sure the Special|Allow Intersection is checked. Then move the end of one of the contours close to the end of the other. The cursor will change to a hollow cross to indicate that it has detected another vertex. When you release the mouse, the vertex will be placed exactly over the position of the other vertex. Reducing the number of vertices in a layer can make the export process faster. If the vertices are much more closely spaced than the grid spacing, reducing the number of vertices may have little effect on the model inputs. To reduce the number of vertices in the contours in a layer first turn Allow Intersection on for that layer. Then select Declutter Contours from the File|Import menu. A dialog box will appear with a list of information layers. Select the information layer in which you wish to reduce the number of vertices. Another dialog box will appear in which you should enter the desired vertex spacing and/or the minimum angle to prevent node removal When you click OK the contours on the layer will be processed so that vertices that are closer together than the desired spacing will be eliminated if the Delete nodes based on spacing check box is checked. However, if the Delete Node based on angle check box is checked, nodes will only be deleted if the angle at the node exceeds the limit you specify. The effects of Declutter Contours is illustrated below. The first diagram shows contours with very closely spaced vertices. In the second illustration, many of the vertices have been eliminated. Before Declutter Contours applied After Declutter Contours applied A word of warning about the Declutter Contours method. After removing vertices, some contours that previously did not overlap may overlap and the geometric relationships among contours may differ. For example, in the illustrations below, the -200 ft contour has been reduced to a single point that is no longer inside the -150 ft contour as it was before. Before Declutter Contours applied After Declutter Contours applied Both the Join Contours and Declutter methods first clear the layer before writing to it. If there is an error when writing the data to the layer, this will result in loss of data. An error might occur in the Declutter PIE if Allow Intersection is turned off and some of the contours cross each other after some vertices are removed. Thus it is a good idea to save your file before running either of these PIEs. Back to Contents copyright, 1998^0^0";

Method Default Expression: 0 Related HST3D Variable: WQMETH HST3D Data Set Record Number: 2.13.1 Method is the index for well-flow calculation method. The following are valid values 10 - Specified well-flow rate with allocation by mobility and pressure difference 11 - Specified well-flow rate with allocation by mobility 12 - Specified well-flow rate with allocation by mobility and pressure difference and limiting mass fraction for production 13 - Specified well-flow rate with allocation by mobility and limiting mass fraction for production 20 - Specified pressure at well datum with allocation by mobility and pressure difference. 30 - Specified well-flow rate with a limiting pressure at well datum.

Mobility is determined by the permeability of a cell the dimensions of the cell, the well radius, and the viscosity of the fluid. See Kipp (1987) equations 2.4.1.2 and 2.4.1.5. Pressure difference is difference in pressure between the average pressure of the cell and the pressure inside the well. If a Limiting pressure is used in an injection well, and the pressure calculated with the specified flow rate is greater than the limiting pressure, the flow rate will be reduced so that the limiting pressure is not exceeded. If a Limiting pressure is used in an production well, and the pressure calculated with the specified flow rate is less than the limiting pressure, the flow rate will be reduced so that the well pressure does not fall below the limiting pressure.

An well completion factor of zero means the well is cased off from the aquifer in that element. A reduced permeability around the well bore can be approximately represented by specifying a completion factor less than one. Note that this is not the same as a well-skin factor. You should not use a cell complection factor of 0 for the element just below the Top Completion Elevation or just above the Bottom Completion Elevation. Instead, adjust the Top or Bottom Completion Elevations. The well-completion factor also can be used to compute an approximate effective permeability for a well that is completed in a cell that contains multiple zones of different permeability. Well Skin Factor Unit[i] Default Expression: 0 Related HST3D Variable: WSF HST3D Data Set Record Number: 2.13.3 A positive skin factor corresponds to a reduced permeability around the well bore. An enhanced permeability around the well bore can be approximately represented by specifying a skin factor less than zero. Note that this is not the same as a well-completion factor.

Surface and well-datum concentrations are equal , so this variable also is used to specify surface conditions for an injection well. Alternatively, it is used for specification of a limit on the production concentration. Normally, Mass Fraction[i] and Scaled Mass Fraction[i] parameters are not both present simultaneously The mass fraction must be between W0 and W1. Scaled Mass Fraction[i] Default Expression: 0 Related HST3D Variable: PWKT HST3D Data Set Record Number: 3.2.2 Scaled mass fraction at the well datum for this well for the time period starting at Time[i]. Surface and well-datum concentrations are equal , so this variable also is used to specify surface conditions for an injection well. Alternatively, it is used for specification of a limit on the production concentration. Normally, Mass Fraction[i] and Scaled Mass Fraction[i] parameters are not both present simultaneously The scaled mass fraction must be in the range 0 to 1. Mobility: Mobility refers to the ease with which water that will flow between an aquifer and a well for a given head gradient. Thus, as permeability increases, mobility also increases. For unconfined aquifers, mobility also depends on the saturated thickness. As the saturated thickness increases, the mobility increases. Changes in viscosity due to changes in temperature or salinity also affect mobility. Mobility is also affected by the well bore diameter. When the diameter is larger, it is easier for water to flow to or from the well. Back to Contents copyright, 1998^0^0";
