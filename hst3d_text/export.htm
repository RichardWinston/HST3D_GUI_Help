<h1>Exporting X, Y, Z  Values</h1>

You may wish to use an independent program to produce post-processing plots. To do so you need to export the data in a form that those programs can understand. Most such programs should be able to use a tab-delimited file of X, Y, Z values where X and Y are the data locations and Z is the data value. There is an easy way to export this data from any Argus ONE model.

   <LI>Import data into Argus ONE with the postprocessing PIE.</LI>
   <LI>Switch to the Data layer (In HST3D, this is named &quot;HST3D Data&quot;).</LI>
   <LI>Select View|Show Values.</LI>
   <LI>Select the columns you wish to copy by selecting one of the corner cells holding down the shift key while clicking on the cells in the opposite corner. </LI>
   <LI>Copy to the clipboard with Ctrl-C.</LI>
   <LI>Paste in a spreadsheet with Ctrl-V.</LI>
   <li >Export the data from the spreadsheet to a text file.</li>
</OL>
You can also paste the data directly into some text editors and skip the spreadsheet. Edit Pad, a free text editor from <a href="http://www.ping.be/jg/">http://www.ping.be/jg/</a>, can be used for this purpose.
