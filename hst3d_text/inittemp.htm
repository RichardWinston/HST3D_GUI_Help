You can not set the initial temperature simply by setting the default value of the layer. You must use contours
to set the initial temperature. Any HST3D Cell that is enclosed or intercepted by a closed contour will be
assigned the value of that contour. Any HST3D Cell intercepted by a point or open contour will be assigned the
value of that contour. If a cell is assigned a value through two or more contours, the value ultimately used by
HST3D will depend on the order in which the contours were created. The value assigned with the most recently
created contour will be the one used by HST3D.

See <a href="nodeinterpolate.htm">how to use Argus ONE's interpolation methods on node layers</a> for a method of overcoming the limitations of how data on node layers is defined.
